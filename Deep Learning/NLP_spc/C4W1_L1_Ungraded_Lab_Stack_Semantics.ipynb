        "In this ungraded lab, we will explain the stack semantics in Trax. This will help in understanding how to use layers like `Select` and `Residual` which gets . If you've taken a computer science class before, you will recall that a stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. That is, whatever is the latest element that is pushed into the stack will also be the first one to be popped out. If you're not yet familiar with stacks, then you may find this [short tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_data_structure/python_stack.htm) useful. In a nutshell, all you really need to remember is it puts elements one on top of the other. You should be aware of what is on top of the stack to know which element you will be popping. You will see this in the discussions below. Let's get started!"

In the example below, you'll notice that in the last step, we specify `tl.Residual(Addition())`. If you refer to the same figure above, you'll notice that the stack at that point has `21 4` where `21` is the top of the stack. The Residual layer remembers this value (i.e. `21`) so the result of the `Addition()` layer nested into it (i.e. `25`) is added to this stack top input to arrive at the result: `46`."
