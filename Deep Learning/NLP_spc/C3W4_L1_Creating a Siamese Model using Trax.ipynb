You should be familiar with the following layers (notice each layer can be clicked to go to the docs):\n",
        "   - [`Serial`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Serial) A combinator layer that allows to stack layers serially using function composition.\n",
        "   - [`Embedding`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Embedding) Maps discrete tokens to vectors. It will have shape `(vocabulary length X dimension of output vectors)`. The dimension of output vectors (also called `d_feature`) is the number of elements in the word embedding.\n",
        "   - [`LSTM`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.rnn.LSTM) The LSTM layer. It leverages another Trax layer called [`LSTMCell`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.rnn.LSTMCell). The number of units should be specified and should match the number of elements in the word embedding.\n",
        "   - [`Mean`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Mean) Computes the mean across a desired axis. Mean uses one tensor axis to form groups of values and replaces each group with the mean value of that group.\n",
        "   - [`Fn`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn) Layer with no weights that applies the function f, which should be specified using a lambda syntax. \n",
        "   - [`Parallel`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Parallel) It is a combinator layer (like `Serial`) that applies a list of layers in parallel to its inputs.\n",
