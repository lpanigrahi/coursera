        "Welcome to the first assignment of week 2. In this assignment, you will:\n",
        "1. Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK. \n",
        "2. See how you can in a couple of hours build a deep learning algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why are we using Keras? \n",
        "\n",
        "* Keras was developed to enable deep learning engineers to build and experiment with different models very quickly. \n",
        "* Just as TensorFlow is a higher-level framework than Python, Keras is an even higher-level framework and provides additional abstractions. \n",
        "* Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to finding good models. \n",
        "* However, Keras is more restrictive than the lower-level frameworks, so there are some very complex models that you would still implement in TensorFlow rather than in Keras. \n",
        "* That being said, Keras will work fine for many common models. "
